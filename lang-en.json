  "project1_details": [
    "Development Time: July 2021 - March 2023",
    "Responsibilities and Achievements:",
    "1. Implemented DDD agile development to ensure stable project iterations and launches",
    "2. Organized 100+ code reviews for 20+ developers, identified 200+ quality issues",
    "3. To address the challenges of large transaction volumes, extensive wide table content, and slow generation during monthly and annual closing periods, ClickHouse + Flink was adopted to achieve integrated stream and batch processing, summarizing transaction data and enhancing transaction performance from 30 minutes to 30 seconds.",
    "4. APM and Grafana monitoring tools were introduced to visualize thread count, CPU usage, and other data during container operation. Once issues such as OOM were detected, headDump files were downloaded for analysis and handling.",
    "5. OpenResty was utilized to build an API gateway through the combination of Nginx and Lua scripts",
    "6. Redis and Caffeine caching middleware were introduced to improve system concurrency efficiency",
    "7. Led the project to upgrade from VUE2 to VUE3."

  "project2_details": [
    "Development Time: March 2023 - Present",
    "Responsibilities and Achievements:",
    "1. Developed front-end and back-end functionalities including product display, coupon handling, order processing, and integration with third-party services",
    "2. Design a cache queue model to address inventory concurrency issues, increasing the concurrency from 500 to about 10,000",
    "3.  For product search scenarios, design multiple rounds of dynamic prompt templates, optimising semantic understanding based on real-time user behaviour data (such as clicks and favourites), increasing search accuracy by 25%. For example, the user can make a vague query for 'light and thin models suitable for summer' to dynamically associate characteristics such as brand, material, and price range",
    "4. Build a cold-start solution for recommendation systems: Using few-shot learning technology and the industry model fine-tuning capabilities of HUAWEI CLOUD's JointPilot platform, the recommendation coverage rate is increased from 60% to 85% in data-sparse scenarios.",
    "5. Lead the construction of a product knowledge graph: Integrate over 100,000 SKUs of structured data (brands, categories, attributes) and unstructured data (user reviews, graphic details), using HUAWEI CLOUD's data cleaning and processing tools to achieve multi-source data fusion to support large model training and inference.",
    "6. Introduce RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology: Use real-time inventory, promotion rules, and other business data as an external knowledge base, linking with the large model through the LangChain framework to address the issue that traditional recommendation systems cannot respond to business changes in real time, optimising the response speed of related scenarios to within 500ms."
